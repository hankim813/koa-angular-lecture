# Intro

AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. Angular's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write. And it all happens within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology.

Angular is what HTML would have been, had it been designed for applications. HTML is a great declarative language for static documents. It does not contain much in the way of creating applications, and as a result building web applications is an exercise in what do I have to do to trick the browser into doing what I want?

## MVC vs. MV*

Traditional web applications and frameworks like Ruby on Rails adopt an MVC structure where the controller bridges the model and the view. But in Angular, because everything is done in the browser, the "view" is a star since it also acts as the controller.

## Style Conventions

The way I write Angular has been pretty influenced by an awesome style guide [here](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide)! I like it because it makes my code readable and consistent across my applications.
