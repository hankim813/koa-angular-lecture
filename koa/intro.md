# Intro

[Koa](http://koajs.com/) is a new web framework designed by the team behind Express, which aims to be a **smaller**, more **expressive**, and more **robust** foundation for web applications and APIs. Through leveraging generators Koa allows you to ditch callbacks and greatly increase error-handling. Koa does not bundle any middleware within core, and provides an elegant suite of methods that make writing servers fast and enjoyable.
